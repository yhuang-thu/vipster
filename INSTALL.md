# Installation instructions

Vipster has four main components:
- *QtVipster*, a desktop-application
- *PyVipster*, python bindings to accomodate scripting
- *WebVipster*, a web-application
- *libvipster*, the library everything else is based on

## Precompiled releases

Binary releases of *QtVipster* are provided for Windows, Linux and (infrequently) macOS on [github](https://github.com/sgsaenger/vipster/releases).

An exemplary implementation of *WebVipster* can be found [here](https://sgsaenger.github.io/vipster/emscripten).

An easy way to install *PyVipster* is via pip and PyPi: `pip install vipster`

### QtVipster on Windows

Windows releases are distributed as .7z archives, so please make sure to unpack it with [7-Zip](https://7-zip.org).

### QtVipster on Linux

For Arch Linux, PKBUILDs are available in the AUR as *vipster* (latest release) and *vipster-git* (following the latest developments).
This also contains the python bindings.

Other distributions may follow.

If your distribution does not offer a package, there is a portable .AppImage file you can download from the releases page. This can be made executable and used directly:
```
chmod +x Vipster-Linux-x86_64.AppImage
./Vipster-Linux-x86_64.AppImage
```

## Build from source

In order to compile Vipster, you need a working [cmake (>= 3.9)](https://cmake.org) installation.

Your C++ compiler should support C++17.
Vipster is tested against GCC (>=8) and Clang (>=4).
So far, MSVC is not supported, please use MinGW (>=9) if you are on Windows (see e.g. [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org)).

### Dependencies

*QtVipster* requires Qt in version >=5.10.

Other dependencies are listed in `external/README.md`.
If they are not installed in your system,
they are included as git submodules and will be configured automatically during the build.
(This can be disabled by providing `-DVIPSTER_DOWNLOAD_DEPENDENCIES=OFF` to cmake, see below.)

### Build process (simple)

We need two directories:
- `$BUILD_DIR` is the directory that will contain your compiled files and can be chosen freely
- `$SOURCE_DIR` is the path to the Vipster source tree, e.g. where you unzipped the download or cloned the Git tree.

All commands shall be executed in `$BUILD_DIR`.
Vipster is built in multiple steps:

1. Configure the build via CMake (see below for more options):
```
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release $SOURCE_DIR
```

2. Perform the compilation:
```
cmake --build .
```

3. (Optional, not Windows) Install your compiled program:
```
cmake --build . -- install
```

### Build with options (advanced)

You can provide options to CMake to further configure your installation.
All options are given in the form of `-D<OPTION>=<VALUE>`.
Step 1 can be repeated multiple times to apply modifications to the current configuration.
You can also use `cmake-gui` (graphical) or `ccmake` (terminal) to change options interactively.
After changing the configuration, execute Step 2 (and 3) again to update your compiled (installed) files.

List of common/vipster options, see [CMake documentation](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-variables.7.html) for more information:
- CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE: General compiler options, set to "Release" for a normal build or "Debug" for debugging
- CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX: Set install path, defaults to `/usr/local`. Common setting for a per-user install: `$HOME/.local`
- VIPSTER_DESKTOP: Set to "ON" to build QtVipster, "OFF" otherwise (default if Qt is found)
- VIPSTER_LAMMPS: Set to "ON" to enable embedded LAMMPS widget (depends on QtVipster).
                  Will use a suitable installation if found, else will build it in-tree.
                  See the [LAMMPS-Manual](https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/Manual.html) for more information and configuration options.
- VIPSTER_PYWIDGET: Set to "ON" to enable embedded Python widget (depends on QtVipster, defaults to "ON" if Python is found)
- VIPSTER_PYLIB: Set to "ON" to build standalone Python library (defaults to "ON" if Python is found)
- VIPSTER_DOWNLOAD_DEPENDENCIES: Set to "OFF" to disable automatic git submodule initialization
- BUILD_TESTING: Set to "OFF" to disable testing ("ON" by default)
- CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH: Set to path for your Qt installation if not found automatically


### Debugging/Tests

If you intend to debug this software, you can enable debug information and disable optimizations by specifying `-D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`.

Unit tests are built by default (see `BUILD_TESTING`) and can be executed via `ctest`.

### Web-Frontend

A feature-reduced browser frontend is available for browsers supporting WebGL2 and WebAssembly.
Use [emscripten](http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site) for building:
```
cd $BUILD_DIR
emcmake cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -D VIPSTER_WEB=ON $SOURCE_DIR
emcmake cmake --build .
```

This prepares a .wasm file that contains the code, and a .js file that contains the Javascript interface.
To use this, one needs to embed it in a webpage and bind the exposed functions to HTML-events.
An example implementation can be found in `gh-pages/emscripten`.

#### Rebuild CSS

To rebuild the webpage's css, run
```
npm install
```
in `gh-pages/emscripten`. This will pull in dependencies and rebuild `styles.css`.

The following NPM scripts are available:

* `npm run build`:

    Compiles the SCSS code and executes the PostCSS Autoprefixer afterwards

* `npm run css:watch`:

    Starts the watch-mode: As soon as one of the SCSS files under `styles/` is changed, a CSS rebuild is triggered automatically.
